NAME
    Spreadsheet::XLSX - Perl extension for reading MS Excel 2007 files;

SYNOPSIS
     use Text::Iconv;
     my $converter = Text::Iconv -> new ("utf-8", "windows-1251");
 
     # Text::Iconv is not really required.
     # This can be any object with the convert method. Or nothing.

     use Spreadsheet::XLSX;
 
     my $excel = Spreadsheet::XLSX -> new ('test.xlsx', $converter);
 
     foreach my $sheet (@{$excel -> {Worksheet}}) {
 
            printf("Sheet: %s\n", $sheet->{Name});
        
            $sheet -> {MaxRow} ||= $sheet -> {MinRow};
        
             foreach my $row ($sheet -> {MinRow} .. $sheet -> {MaxRow}) {
         
                    $sheet -> {MaxCol} ||= $sheet -> {MinCol};
                
                    foreach my $col ($sheet -> {MinCol} ..  $sheet -> {MaxCol}) {
                
                            my $cell = $sheet -> {Cells} [$row] [$col];
 
                            if ($cell) {
                                printf("( %s , %s ) => %s\n", $row, $col, $cell -> {Val});
                            }
 
                    }
 
            }
 
     }

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a (quick and dirty) emulation of Spreadsheet::ParseExcel
    for Excel 2007 (.xlsx) file format. It supports styles and many of
    Excel's quirks, but not all. It populates the classes from
    Spreadsheet::ParseExcel for interoperability; including Workbook,
    Worksheet, and Cell.

    Spreadsheet::Perl
      http://search.cpan.org/~nkh/ offers a Pure Perl implementation of a
      spreadsheet engine. Users that want this format to be supported in
      Spreadsheet::Read are hereby motivated to offer patches. It's not high
      on my todo-list.

    xls2csv
      http://search.cpan.org/~ken/ offers an alternative for my "xlscat -c",
      in the xls2csv tool, but this tool focusses on character encoding
      transparency, and requires some other modules.
